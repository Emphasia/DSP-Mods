# TelePotter

This mod provides the ability to teleport to a target planet or star with two clicks on the star map.

Select the target in the star map to open the menu, and then click the lower left button to transmit.

## Note

- **This mod does not alter any entity or save anything to disk.** 
  This mean the mod SHOULD be very safe to use and will not break your savegame, not even after an update.  
- **Teleporting across stars requires patiently waiting for few seconds**, so that the game can load the data of the target star.
