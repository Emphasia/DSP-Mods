# TelePotter

This mod provides the ability to teleport to a target planet or star with two clicks on the star map.

Select the target in the star map to open the menu, and then click the lower left button to jump.

## Note

- **This mod does not alter any entity or save anything to disk**, so this mod SHOULD be safe to use and will not break your savegame.  
- **Teleporting across stars requires patiently waiting for few seconds**, so that the game can load the data of the target star.
